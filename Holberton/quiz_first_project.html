        Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude
        service. The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point
        path for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers
        can be used without significant interference with each other, outside of
        early spring. This is because of the 3D ether space available to the
        carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers
        have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which increases
        availability.

        People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on.
        But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred
        other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m
        actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have
        done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
